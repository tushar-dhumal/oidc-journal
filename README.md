One-Stop OIDC Tester and Integration Guide
OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It enables client applications to rely on authentication that is performed by an OIDC Provider to verify the identity of a user. Clients can also obtain basic profile information about a user and exchange it in a REST-like manner from OIDC Providers.
